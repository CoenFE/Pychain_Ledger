# Pychain_Ledger

In this task I have built a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow users to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Instructions 

Streamlit was utilised to run this program through a localhost webpage where you can add blocks to the chain and validate them.

As you can see above, you are able to input parapateres (buyer, sender, amount), set the difficulty using the slider and add the block directly to the chain. You can then see the block added to the ledger below in real time, and just below a validator button outputting a Boolean.
